## Overview :fountain_pen: ##
Welcome to the iPhone 15 Pro Launch Demo Project â€“ a showcase of React capability and visually stunning web development. This project is a mock website designed to demonstrate my development expertise, featuring captivating animations, lifelike 3D rendering, and exquisite design (As only Apple does). Built with React and JavaScript, and enhanced with GSAP for animations, Three.js for 3D modeling, and Tailwind CSS for aesthetics, this demo is a testament to innovation and creativity in web development.
